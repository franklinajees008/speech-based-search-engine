# Speech-Based Search Engine

This project is a simple voice-activated web search tool built using Python. It allows users to speak their search queries, recognizes the speech, and opens the relevant Google search results in a web browser.

## Features

* Voice-based user input
* Speech-to-text using Google Web Speech API
* Text-to-speech feedback
* Automatic web search via the default browser

## Requirements

Install the necessary Python packages before running:

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 pyaudio
```

> **Note:** `pyaudio` can be tricky to install. You may need platform-specific steps or precompiled binaries.

## How It Works

1. The program uses `pyttsx3` to prompt the user to speak.
2. It listens through the microphone using `speech_recognition`.
3. Converts the spoken words into text.
4. Opens a Google search for the recognized query using `webbrowser`.

## Usage

Run the script with:

```bash
python speech\ based\ search\ engine.py
```

Speak clearly when prompted. The script will search for the spoken query on Google.

## File Overview

* `take_command()` – Captures audio and converts it to text.
* `speak(text)` – Uses text-to-speech to provide audio feedback.
* `search_web(query)` – Opens a Google search for the query in the browser.
* `main` block – Controls the flow: takes input and performs the search.

## Limitations

* Requires a stable internet connection for speech recognition.
* Accuracy depends on microphone quality and ambient noise.
* Only supports English voice input by default.
